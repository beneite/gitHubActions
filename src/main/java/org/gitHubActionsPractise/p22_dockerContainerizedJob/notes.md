You're using a GitHub Actions workflow with this configuration:

---

## 🔧 Workflow Name: `p22_dockerContainerizedJob`

### 📜 Description:

> Running a simple container inside our runner machine.

However, what you're **actually doing** is:

> Running the **entire job inside a Docker container** (`node:24-alpine3.21`) that is **spawned by GitHub Actions** — not running a container *inside* the runner VM, but making the container the runtime for the job.

---

## ✅ What This Workflow Does — Line by Line:

### \`\`\`yaml

on:
workflow\_dispatch:

````
🔹 This allows the workflow to be **manually triggered** from the GitHub UI ("Run workflow" button).

---

### ```yaml
jobs:
  note-container-in-runner-job:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
````

🔹 Tells GitHub to run this job on a **GitHub-hosted Ubuntu virtual machine (VM)**.

---

### \`\`\`yaml

```
container:
  image: node:24-alpine3.21
```

````
🔹 This means:  
> “Run the job **inside** a Docker container using the image `node:24-alpine3.21`.”

- So even though the VM is Ubuntu, **your steps will run inside this Alpine-based Node container**.
- GitHub pulls the image, runs a container from it, and runs your `steps` in that container.

---

### ```yaml
    env:
      BASE_URL: www.beneite.com
````

🔹 This sets an **environment variable (`BASE_URL`)** that will be available inside the container runtime.

---

### ⚙️ Steps

#### Step 1:

```yaml
- name: Log node version
  run: node -v
```

✔ Prints the Node.js version — should match the version bundled in `node:24-alpine3.21`.

#### Step 2:

```yaml
- name: Log the OS version
  run: |
    cat /etc/os-release
    echo "OS version: $(uname -a)"
```

✔ Logs OS info.
Even though the GitHub runner is Ubuntu, this will print **Alpine Linux info**, because you're inside the container.

#### Step 3:

```yaml
- name: Print value for container env variable BASE_ENV
  run: echo $BASE_URL
```

✔ Prints the value of the environment variable `BASE_URL` set earlier (`www.beneite.com`).
