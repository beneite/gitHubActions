name: workflow_dispatch - Run Test cases branch=manualTriggerBranch

description: |
  This work flow will run for branch manualTriggerBranch, so you can switch that branch and run.
  This workflow allows a user to manually trigger smoke, sanity, or regression test suites.
  The user must provide their name, test priority, and select the type of test they want to execute.
  It will only run on the branch named 'manualTriggerBranch'.
