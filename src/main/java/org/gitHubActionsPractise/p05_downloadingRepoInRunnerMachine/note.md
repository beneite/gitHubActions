# This GitHub Actions workflow is named:

> **"workflow to download the repo on runner machine"**

and it's designed to **demonstrate how a GitHub-hosted runner checks out (downloads) the repository code** and what the runner's filesystem looks like before and after that process.

## 🔍 Workflow Trigger

```yaml
on: [ push ]
```

This means the workflow will run **every time you push code to the repository**, no matter the branch.

---

## 🔧 Jobs Section

### ✅ `checkout-repo-job`

This is the only job in the workflow.

```yaml
runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

This tells GitHub to use a **hosted Linux runner** (Ubuntu) for the job.

---

### 🧱 Steps Breakdown

#### 🔹 Step 1: Start the Job

```yaml
run: echo "Starting the Job at $(date)"
```

Prints a timestamp at the beginning of the job.

---

#### 🔹 Step 2: List files before checkout

```yaml
run: ls -a
```

Lists all files and folders in the **runner’s working directory** (usually empty before repo checkout). You’ll likely only see:

```
.
..
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 3: Check out the repo

```yaml
uses: actions/checkout@v4
```

This is the **official GitHub Action** to:

* Clone the current repository (the one where the workflow is defined)
* Check out the latest commit that triggered the workflow

This makes your repo's code **available on the runner's file system** for the next steps.

---

#### 🔹 Step 4: List files after checkout

```yaml
run: ls -a
```

This lists files again after the checkout. You’ll now see your project files, like:

```
.
..
README.md
.github
src/
pom.xml
```

---

#### 🔹 Step 5: End the Job

```yaml
run: echo "Ended the Job at $(date)"
```

Prints the time the job finishes — useful for seeing total job duration.

# Post steps

---
Yes — those **“post” steps** you're seeing after your workflow completes are **automatic cleanup steps** handled by GitHub Actions itself. They are **normal and expected**.

---

### ✅ Example You Might See in the Logs

```text
Post Run actions/checkout@v4
Post job cleanup.
```

---

### 🔍 Why This Happens

Many GitHub Actions (like `actions/checkout`, `setup-java`, `setup-node`, etc.) have **"post-run scripts"** defined. These scripts clean up temporary files, reverse environment changes, or handle caching.

For example:

* `actions/checkout@v4`:

    * Cleans up Git credentials and temporary config.
* `setup-java`:

    * Unregisters environment variables or temp JDKs.
* Any `run:` command might also trigger workspace cleanup.

---

### 🔧 You Don’t Need to Do Anything

These post steps:

* Run automatically
* Don’t consume billable minutes separately
* Help keep the runner stateless (fresh for next job)

---

### 🧠 If You Want to Add Your Own "Post Steps"

You can create cleanup steps manually at the end of your job:

```yaml
- name: Cleanup step
  run: echo "Custom cleanup done"
```

But GitHub’s post-job hooks are **automatic for any third-party or built-in action**.

---

Let me know if you’d like to see:

* How to define **your own composite action** with a `post` script
* How to **skip post steps** in some edge cases
* Or how **GitHub runners** isolate and reset between jobs

You're on the right track!
